// lists of type parameters and use them interchangeably. In particular, a
// Service<MyServiceEvents> should be interchangeable with a
// Service<ServiceLifecycleEvents> if MyServiceEvents extends
// ServiceLifecycleEvents. `onAny`'s typing does not allow this, so for the
// Service interface level we use a type that eliminates that method, and thus
// the problem.

/**
 * A simple interface for service lifecycles and event emission. Services
 * should emit a `serviceStarted` event when they are started, and a
 * `serviceStopped` event when they are stopped. It is strongly recommended
 * that all services have a single static `create` method to create but not
 * start the service. This method should adhere to `ServiceCreatorFunction` for
 * consistency.
 *
 * Services are generally considered to have three phases: created, started,
 * and stopped. Once services are created, they should have any internal and
 * local state initialized. Once started, they should have any external state,
 * such as subscriptions to external systems and polling set up. Events should
 * not be emitted before a service is started. This creates an ideal moment to
 * hook up event handlers _after_ the service has been created but _before_ it
 * has been started.
 *
 * Implementors, see {@link BaseService} for a good base class that handles
 * most of the lifecycle details.
